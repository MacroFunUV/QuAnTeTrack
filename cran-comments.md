## R CMD check results (Resubmision)
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There were 2 NOTEs:

1. **New submission**  
   This is the first release of the package.

2. **Version contains large components (0.1.0)**  
   The version number has been updated to `0.1.0` for the first CRAN release, following standard versioning.

3. **Possibly misspelled words**  
   The following terms are domain-specific and intentionally used:
   - "Tetrapod", "Trackways", "palaeo", "tetrapod", "trackways"

4. **Moved Permanently (301)**  
   Previous links pointing to `tree/master/...` have been updated to `blob/master/...`.

5. **Examples runtime**  
   A few examples (e.g., `plot_sim()`, `simulate_track()`) exceed 5 seconds. These are kept to demonstrate simulation-based functionality central to the packageâ€™s purpose. However, the vignette demonstrates these in controlled conditions with reduced `nsim`.
