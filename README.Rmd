Studying fossil vertebrate trackways is crucial as they provide valuable insights into the behavior, locomotion, and environmental interactions of extinct species, offering a dynamic perspective on prehistoric life that skeletal remains alone cannot. Here, I present **QuAnTeTrack**, an integrated tool designed to **semi-automatically extract palaeobiological information** by digitizing footprint and trackway coordinates and analyzing them within the R environment. 

QuAnTeTrack includes functions to read footprint coordinates and trackways stored as **.TPS files**, transforming them into **"track" objects**. These objects can be used to **calculate and plot key parameters** such as **turning angles, trackway distances, step lengths, sinuosity, and straightness**. Additional functions enable the **quantification of velocity** and the testing of scenarios involving **acceleration, deceleration, or stable velocity**, as well as comparing velocity differences between tracks. 

The tool also supports **visualizing movement patterns**, plotting tracks according to velocity. Furthermore, **QuAnTeTrack facilitates the testing of hypotheses related to gregarious behavior or predatory events**. For interactions involving multiple tetrapods, such as **group movement or predation**, trackways are expected to covary more significantly and present fewer intersections than those generated by independent events. QuAnTeTrack estimates this by computing **Frechet and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) trajectory similarity metrics** and **quantifying track intersections**. These metrics are evaluated through **random simulation procedures** to determine how actual trackway similarities differ from randomly generated ones under various scenarios, including **geographical constraints and resource directionality**.

## Installation

You can install the development version of QuAnTeTrack from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MacroFunUV/QuAnTeTrack")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(QuAnTeTrack)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
