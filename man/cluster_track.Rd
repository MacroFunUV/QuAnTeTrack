\value{
A 'track clustering' R object consisting of a list containing the following elements:
\itemize{
\item matrix: A data frame containing the movement parameters calculated for each track.

\itemize{
\item call: The matched call.
\item data: The input data matrix.

\item parameters: A list with the following components:
\itemize{
\item pro: A vector whose k\eqn{^{th}} component is the mixing proportion for the k\eqn{^{th}} component of the mixture model. If missing, equal proportions are assumed.

\description{
\code{cluster_track()} clusters trajectories based on various movement and velocity parameters calculated for each track.
}
\details{
The \code{cluster_track()} function performs a model-based clustering analysis on track parameters using the \code{Mclust()} function from the \pkg{mclust} package.

The function first filters out tracks with fewer than four steps, as these tracks may not provide reliable movement data.
It then calculates various movement parameters for each remaining track, including turning angles, distances, lengths, sinuosity, straightness, and velocities.
Finally, the selected movement parameters are used as input for clustering the tracks.

If only one parameter is selected, the clustering is performed using equal variance (\code{"E"}) and variable variance (\code{"V"}) Gaussian models.
If more than one parameter is selected, all Gaussian models available in \code{mclust.options("emModelNames")} are considered.

The following movement parameters can be included in the clustering:
\itemize{
\item \code{"TurnAng"}: Turning angles for the track, measured in degrees. This measures how much the direction of movement changes at each step.
\item \code{"sdTurnAng"}: The standard deviation of the turning angles, indicating how variable the turning angles are across the track.
\item \code{"Distance"}: The total distance covered by the track, calculated as the sum of the straight-line distances between consecutive points (in meters).
\item \code{"Length"}: The overall length of the track, a straight-line distance between the starting and ending points (in meters).
\item \code{"StLength"}: Step lengths for each step of the track, representing how far the object moved between two consecutive points (in meters).
\item \code{"sdStLength"}: The standard deviation of the step lengths, showing how consistent the steps are in length.
\item \code{"Sinuosity"}: A measure of the track's winding nature, calculated as the ratio of the actual track length to the straight-line distance (dimensionless).
\item \code{"Straightness"}: The straightness of the track, calculated as the straight-line distance divided by the total path length (dimensionless).
\item \code{"Velocity"}: The average velocity of the track, calculated as the total distance divided by the time elapsed between the first and last footprint (in meters per second).
\item \code{"sdVelocity"}: The standard deviation of the velocity, indicating how much the velocity fluctuates throughout the track.
\item \code{"MaxVelocity"}: The maximum velocity achieved during the track, identifying the fastest point (in meters per second).
\item \code{"MinVelocity"}: The minimum velocity during the track, identifying the slowest point (in meters per second).
}

The \code{cluster_track()} function has biological relevance in identifying groups of tracks with similar movement parameters,
providing insights into ecological and behavioral patterns. By clustering tracks based on characteristics such as sinuosity,
velocity, and turning angles, it allows detecting movement patterns associated with specific behaviors. This can help identify tracks
potentially made by individuals moving together, which is useful for investigating hypotheses on gregarious behavior, predation
strategies, or coordinated movement. Additionally, clustering serves as a preliminary step before similarity tests and
simulations, refining track selection and improving hypothesis testing in movement ecology studies.
