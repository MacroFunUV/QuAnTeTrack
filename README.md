Studying fossil vertebrate trackways is crucial as they provide valuable
insights into the behavior, locomotion, and environmental interactions
of extinct species, offering a dynamic perspective on prehistoric life
that skeletal remains alone cannot. Here, I present **QuAnTeTrack**, an
integrated tool designed to **semi-automatically extract
palaeobiological information** by digitizing footprint and trackway
coordinates and analyzing them within the R environment.

QuAnTeTrack includes functions to read footprint coordinates and
trackways stored as **.TPS files**, transforming them into **“track”
objects**. These objects can be used to **calculate and plot key
parameters** such as **turning angles, trackway distances, step lengths,
sinuosity, and straightness**. Additional functions enable the
**quantification of velocity** and the testing of scenarios involving
**acceleration, deceleration, or stable velocity**, as well as comparing
velocity differences between tracks.

The tool also supports **visualizing movement patterns**, plotting
tracks according to velocity. Furthermore, **QuAnTeTrack facilitates the
testing of hypotheses related to gregarious behavior or predatory
events**. For interactions involving multiple tetrapods, such as **group
movement or predation**, trackways are expected to covary more
significantly and present fewer intersections than those generated by
independent events. QuAnTeTrack estimates this by computing **Frechet
and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) trajectory similarity metrics** and
**quantifying track intersections**. These metrics are evaluated through
**random simulation procedures** to determine how actual trackway
similarities differ from randomly generated ones under various
scenarios, including **geographical constraints and resource
directionality**.

## Installation

You can install the development version of QuAnTeTrack from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MacroFunUV/QuAnTeTrack")
```

## Example

<<<<<<< HEAD
``` r
# Example 1: Tracks without missing footprints. Based on the Paluxy River
# dinosaur chase sequence (Farlow et al., 2011).

# Load the example TPS file provided in the QuAnTeTrack package.
# This TPS data includes footprint coordinates for different tracks,
# along with associated metadata.
tpsPaluxyRiver <- system.file("extdata", "PaluxyRiver.tps", package = "QuAnTeTrack")

# Call the tps_to_track function to convert the TPS data in the file
# into a track object. The 'scale' argument sets the scaling factor
# for the coordinates, and 'missing=FALSE' indicates that no landmarks
# are missing in the dataset.
