Studying fossil vertebrate trackways is crucial as they provide valuable insights into the behavior, locomotion, and environmental interactions of extinct species, offering a dynamic perspective on prehistoric life that skeletal remains alone cannot. Here, I present **QuAnTeTrack**, an integrated tool designed to **semi-automatically extract palaeobiological information** by digitizing footprint and trackway coordinates and analyzing them within the R environment. 

QuAnTeTrack includes functions to read footprint coordinates and trackways stored as **.TPS files**, transforming them into **"track" objects**. These objects can be used to **calculate and plot key parameters** such as **turning angles, trackway distances, step lengths, sinuosity, and straightness**. Additional functions enable the **quantification of velocity** and the testing of scenarios involving **acceleration, deceleration, or stable velocity**, as well as comparing velocity differences between tracks. 

The tool also supports **visualizing movement patterns**, plotting tracks according to velocity. Furthermore, **QuAnTeTrack facilitates the testing of hypotheses related to gregarious behavior or predatory events**. For interactions involving multiple tetrapods, such as **group movement or predation**, trackways are expected to covary more significantly and present fewer intersections than those generated by independent events. QuAnTeTrack estimates this by computing **Frechet and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) trajectory similarity metrics** and **quantifying track intersections**. These metrics are evaluated through **random simulation procedures** to determine how actual trackway similarities differ from randomly generated ones under various scenarios, including **geographical constraints and resource directionality**.

## Installation

You can install the development version of QuAnTeTrack from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MacroFunUV/QuAnTeTrack")
```

## Example

``` r
# Load package QuAnTeTrack
library(QuAnTeTrack)


# Load data (Replace with your file paths)
PaluxyRiver <- tps_to_track("path/to/PaluxyRiver.tps")
MountTom <- tps_to_track("path/to/MountTom.tps")

# Extract track parameters
track_params_paluxy <- track_param(PaluxyRiver)
track_params_mt <- track_param(MountTom)

# Calculate velocities
H_paluxyriver <- c(3.472, 2.200)
H_mounttom <- c(1.380, 1.404, 1.320, 1.736, 1.364, 1.432, 1.508, 1.768, 1.600, 1.848,
                1.532, 1.532, 0.760, 1.532, 1.688, 1.620, 0.636, 1.784, 1.676, 1.872,
                1.648, 1.760, 1.612)
                
vel_paluxy <- velocity_track(PaluxyRiver, H = H_paluxyriver)
vel_mt <- velocity_track(MountTom, H = H_mounttom)

# Plot track and direction
plot_track(PaluxyRiver)
plot_direction(PaluxyRiver)

# Test directionality (ANOVA)
test_dir_paluxy <- test_direction(PaluxyRiver, analysis = "ANOVA")
test_dir_mt <- test_direction(MountTom, analysis = "ANOVA")

# Plot velocities
plot_velocity(PaluxyRiver, vel_paluxy)
plot_velocity(MountTom, vel_mt)

# Test velocity differences (Kruskal-Wallis)
test_vel_paluxy <- test_velocity(PaluxyRiver, vel_paluxy, analysis = "Kruskal-Wallis", plot = TRUE)
test_vel_mt <- test_velocity(MountTom, vel_mt, analysis = "Kruskal-Wallis", plot = TRUE)

# Simulate tracks using the "Directed" model
sim_paluxy <- simulate_track(PaluxyRiver, nsim = 1000, model = "Directed")
plot_sim(sim_paluxy, PaluxyRiver)

# Compare track similarity using DTW
dtw_similarity <- simil_DTW_metric(PaluxyRiver, PaluxyRiver)
frechet_similarity <- simil_Frechet_metric(PaluxyRiver, PaluxyRiver)

# Calculate intersections
intersection_metrics <- track_intersection(PaluxyRiver, test = TRUE, sim = sim_paluxy, origin.permutation = "None")

# Combine probabilities
combined_prob <- combined_prob(dtw_similarity, intersection_metrics)

# Cluster tracks
clusters <- cluster_track(dtw_similarity)
```
