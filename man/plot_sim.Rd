\usage{
plot_sim(
  data,
  sim,
  colours_sim = NULL,
  alpha_sim = NULL,
  lwd_sim = NULL,
  colours_act = NULL,
  alpha_act = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{track} R object, which is a list consisting of two elements:
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{Trajectories}}: A list of interpolated trajectories, where each trajectory is a series of midpoints between consecutive footprints.
\item \strong{\code{Footprints}}: A list of data frames containing footprint coordinates, metadata (e.g., image reference, ID), and a marker indicating whether the footprint is actual or inferred.
}}

\item{sim}{A \code{track simulation} R object, where each object is a list of simulated trajectories stored as \code{track} R objects.}

\item{colours_sim}{A vector of colors for plotting each set of simulated trajectories. If \code{NULL}, the default color will be black (\code{"#000000"}).}

\item{alpha_sim}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 for the transparency level of simulated trajectories. The default is \code{0.1}.}

\item{lwd_sim}{A numeric value for the line width of the simulated trajectory lines. The default is \code{0.5}.}

\item{colours_act}{A vector of colors for plotting actual trajectories. If \code{NULL}, the default color will be black (\code{"#000000"}).}

\item{alpha_act}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 for the transparency level of actual trajectories. The default is \code{0.6}.}

\item{lwd_act}{A numeric value for the line width of the actual trajectory lines. The default is \code{0.8}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object displaying the simulated and actual trajectories.
}
\description{
\code{plot_sim()} creates a plot that visualizes both simulated and actual movement trajectories. This function is useful for comparing the simulated tracks generated by \code{simulate_track()} with the observed trajectories to evaluate how well the simulation models represent real movement patterns.
}
\details{
The function uses \pkg{ggplot2} to create a plot with the following components:
\itemize{
\item Simulated trajectories are displayed with paths colored according to the \code{colours_sim} parameter, with the specified transparency \code{alpha_sim} and line width \code{lwd_sim}.
\item Actual trajectories are overlaid in the colors specified by \code{colours_act}, with a transparency level \code{alpha_act} and line width \code{lwd_act} to provide a clear comparison.
