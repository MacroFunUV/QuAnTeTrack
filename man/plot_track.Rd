\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{trackway} R object, which is a list consisting of two elements:
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{Trajectories}}: A list of trajectories representing trackway midlines,
interpolated by connecting the midpoints of successive left–right footprint pairs
(i.e., footprints linked by pace lines). Includes columns \code{X}, \code{Y},
\code{IMAGE}, \code{ID}, and \code{Side} (set to \code{"Medial"}).
\item \strong{\code{Footprints}}: A list of data frames containing footprint coordinates
and associated metadata, with a \code{Side} column (\code{"R"} or \code{"L"})
and a \code{missing} marker (\code{"Actual"} or \code{"Inferred"}).
}}

\item{plot}{Type of plot to generate. Options are \code{"FootprintsTrajectories"} (default), \code{"Trajectories"}, or \code{"Footprints"}. Determines what elements are included in the plot.}

\item{colours}{A vector of colors to be used for different trajectories If \code{NULL}, defaults to black. The length of this vector should match the number of trackways in the data.}

\item{cex.f}{The size of the points representing footprints. Default is \code{2.5}. If \code{seq.foot = TRUE}, this controls the text size of footprint sequence numbers.}

\item{shape.f}{A vector of shapes to be used for representing footprints in different trackways. If \code{NULL}, defaults to \code{19} (solid circle). The length of this vector should match the number of trackways in the data.}

\item{alpha.f}{The transparency of the points representing footprints. Default is \code{0.5}.}

\item{cex.t}{The thickness of the trajectory lines. Default is \code{0.5}.}

\item{alpha.t}{The transparency of the trajectory lines. Default is \code{1}.}

\item{plot.labels}{Logical indicating whether to add labels to each trackway. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{labels}{A vector of labels for each trackway. If \code{NULL}, labels are automatically generated from trackway names.}

\item{box.p}{Padding around label boxes, used only if \code{plot.labels} is \code{TRUE}. Adjusts the spacing around the label text.}

\item{cex.l}{The size of the labels. Default is \code{3.88}.}

\item{alpha.l}{The transparency of the labels. Default is \code{0.5}.}

\item{arrow.t}{Logical indicating whether to add an arrowhead at the end of each trajectory to verify direction. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{arrow.size}{Numeric controlling the arrowhead size (in inches, passed to \code{grid::unit()}). Default is \code{0.15}.}

\item{seq.foot}{Logical indicating whether to display the footprint sequence numbers instead of footprint points. Default is \code{FALSE}. This is useful to verify that footprints are in the correct order along each trackway. When \code{TRUE}, the size of the numbers is controlled by \code{cex.f}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object that displays the specified plot type, including trajectories, footprints, or both, from \code{trackway} R objects. The \pkg{ggplot2} package is used for plotting.
}
\description{
\code{plot_track()} visualizes trajectory and footprint data from code{track} R objects in various ways, allowing for the plotting of trajectories, footprints, or both combined, with customizable aesthetics.
}
\details{
The \code{plot_track()} function is designed as a diagnostic and exploratory tool.
Its primary purpose is to display the raw spatial data (footprint coordinates and
interpolated trajectories) that have been digitized, so that users can
visually confirm data integrity before conducting quantitative analyses. This
includes checking whether footprints are in the correct order, whether trackways are
oriented consistently, and whether interpolated trajectories align with the raw
footprint data.

Importantly, these plots are not intended to replace traditional ichnological
illustrations. Hand-drawn maps and outlines often convey information that is not
captured in raw coordinate plots, such as tridactyl morphology, manus/pes
distinction, taxonomic attribution, or trackway orientation, and they frequently
provide clearer and more communicative visual summaries of ichnological material.

By contrast, \code{plot_track()} focuses on plotting digitized data as they are,
without additional interpretation, stylization, or symbolic annotation. The goal is
to offer a reproducible, data-driven representation that complements, rather than
supplants, traditional methods. Users are encouraged to treat these plots as
quality-control visualizations that help detect potential errors or inconsistencies
in the raw data prior to downstream analyses, while continuing to rely on classical
ichnological illustrations for detailed morphological and taxonomic interpretation.
