## **Overview of the Analytical Workflow in QuAnTeTrack**

The **QuAnTeTrack** package (**Qu**antitative **An**alysis of **Te**trapod **Track**ways) provides a structured and comprehensive workflow for analyzing trackway data, facilitating the assessment of paleoecological and paleoethological hypotheses. The workflow integrates various functions for data digitization, loading, exploratory analysis, statistical testing, simulation, similarity assessment, intersection detection, and clustering. This pipeline aims to help researchers reconstruct, compare, and interpret movement patterns and behavioral dynamics of trackmakers.


### **1. Data Digitization and Preprocessing**

The first step involves **digitizing the trackway data** using the **TPS software suite**, particularly:

- **tpsUtil** (*Rohlf, 2008*): For compiling and converting `.TPS` files.  
- **tpsDig** (*Rohlf, 2009*): For digitizing footprint coordinates from trackways.  

The digitization process should ensure that the footprints are consistently recorded across all tracks. This process is essential for converting raw images into structured data for further analysis.


### **2. Loading Data with `tps_to_track()`**

Once digitized, the data is loaded into **QuAnTeTrack** using the `tps_to_track()` function. This function:

- Reads `.TPS` files containing digitized footprints within tracks.
- Extracts and organizes data into structured `track` R objects.
- Handles missing footprints through interpolation if required.
- Converts raw data into real-world measurements using user-specified scales.

The resulting **`track` R objects** contain:

- **Trajectories:** Interpolated pathways derived from midpoints between footprints.  
- **Footprints:** Original digitized points and metadata for each track.  

Additionally, if the dataset is extensive, users can utilize the **`subset_track()`** function to isolate specific tracks for focused analysis. This step helps avoid computational overhead and allows customized analyses of selected trajectories.


### **3. Exploratory Analysis of Track Parameters**

Before testing specific hypotheses, users should perform an initial exploration of the data. This includes:

- **Visual Inspection of Tracks (`plot_track()`)**:  
  Generates visualizations of trackways and footprints to inspect their overall structure. The function offers various modes:
  - Plotting only footprints
  - Plotting only tracks
  - Plotting both footprints and tracks

- **Parameter Calculation (`track_param()`)**:  
  Calculates essential movement parameters, including:
  - Step lengths
  - Turning angles
  - Total distance and track length
  - Sinuosity
  - Straightness
  
- **Velocity Calculation (`velocity_track()`)**:  
  Estimates velocities and relative stride lengths for each track, applying formulas based on empirical studies. This step is crucial for understanding speed dynamics and comparing them across different trackmakers or scenarios.

- **Visualization of Velocity Patterns (`plot_velocity()`)**:  
  Provides a detailed view of how velocity or relative stride length changes along each track. This visualization is essential for identifying patterns of acceleration, deceleration, or steady movement.

- **Direction Analysis (`plot_direction()`)**:  
  Provides various visualization options to explore trackway directionality:
  - Boxplots of step directions
  - Polar histograms of step directions and average directions
  - Faceted plots for comparing multiple tracks
  
These functions help identify general patterns and irregularities in the data before proceeding with formal statistical testing.


### **4. Testing Directional and Velocity Patterns**

To assess whether tracks exhibit distinct movement patterns, the following statistical tests can be applied:

- **Testing Velocity (`test_velocity()`)**:  
  - Compares mean velocities across tracks using ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, or GLM.
  - Performs pairwise comparisons if necessary.
  - Provides visualizations of velocity distributions across different tracks.

- **Movement Mode Analysis (`mode_velocity()`)**:  
  - Applies Spearman’s rank correlation to detect trends of **acceleration**, **deceleration**, or **steady movement** along each track.

- **Testing Direction (`test_direction()`)**:  
  - Uses **ANOVA**, **Kruskal-Wallis**, or **Generalized Linear Models (GLM)** to compare mean directions across tracks.  
  - Performs pairwise comparisons if necessary.

These statistical tests allow researchers to rigorously compare and quantify movement characteristics, providing a foundation for hypothesis testing.


### **5. Simulation-Based Hypothesis Testing (`simulate_track()`)**

The `simulate_track()` function generates **simulated trajectories** based on different movement models to test specific hypotheses. Three models are available:

- **Directed Model:** Represents highly constrained, purposeful movement along a consistent direction.  
- **Constrained Model:** Generates correlated random walks, suitable for partially directed movement.  
- **Unconstrained Model:** Represents fully random exploratory movement.  

These models can be **informed by geological data** (e.g., sedimentology, paleogeomorphology, etc.) to test the influence of environmental constraints on movement. For example, natural barriers or features inferred from geological evidence may restrict the range of simulated paths.

The `plot_sim()` function overlays simulated tracks on the actual trajectories, allowing users to visually assess how well different models replicate observed track patterns. This visual comparison is essential for evaluating the realism of simulated tracks.


### **6. Comparing Simulated and Empirical Tracks**

The **QuAnTeTrack** package offers several functions aimed at comparing similarity and intersection metrics between two or more actual tracks. These metrics are then evaluated against simulated datasets to determine the probability of observing such similarity or intersection counts under scenarios of independent (non-coordinated) movement.

- **Dynamic Time Warping (`simil_DTW_metric()`)**:  
  Compares trajectories based on the optimal alignment of points, allowing for variable path lengths.

- **Fréchet Distance (`simil_Frechet_metric()`)**:  
  Measures similarity by comparing the overall shape of trajectories, focusing on global rather than local alignment.

- **Track Intersections (`track_intersection()`)**:  
  Identifies and counts unique intersections between tracks, which can indicate interaction or coordinated movement.


### **7. Combining Probability Metrics (`combined_prob()`)**

The `combined_prob()` function integrates *p*-values from multiple similarity metrics and intersection tests to provide a more robust assessment of observed patterns. This approach offers an overall measure of significance, enhancing the reliability of the results by accounting for different aspects of similarity and interaction.


### **8. Clustering Analysis (`cluster_track()`)**

The `cluster_track()` function is an optional but powerful step that can be applied **before formal statistical testing**. It clusters tracks based on calculated movement parameters, identifying groups of tracks with similar behaviors. The clustering process:

- Facilitates targeted testing of specific behavioral hypotheses (e.g., gregarious movement).
- Helps filter relevant datasets before applying similarity metrics.
- Informs the selection of appropriate simulation models by identifying common movement characteristics.


## **Raw Data Format**  
**QuAnTeTrack** accepts raw data in the form of **.TPS files** containing footprint coordinates. Each track should be recorded as a different image within the **.TPS file**.  

### **Requirements**  
- **Footprint coordinates** should be digitized in **equivalent positions** within each footprint.  
- **Tracks with missing footprints** are acceptable and will be **interpolated** as needed by the package functions.  
- It is **recommended** to digitize the coordinates using the **TPS software suite**, particularly:  
  - **tpsUtil** (*Rohlf, 2008*) - for file manipulation and data conversion.  
  - **tpsDig** (*Rohlf, 2009*) - for digitizing landmarks and outlines.  

This vignette demonstrates how to **load, process, and analyze trackway data** using the **QuAnTeTrack** package. We will walk through the **Paluxy River** and the **Mount Tom** datasets, representing dinosaur tracks from the Paluxy River site (**Farlow et al. (2012)**) and the Mount Tom site (**Ostrom (1972)**), respectively. Examples of `.tps` files of these datasets can be downloaded here:

  - [Paluxy River](../inst/extdata/PaluxyRiver.tps)
  - [Mount Tom](../inst/extdata/MountTom.tps)


## **Loading and Converting Data**  

The **`tps_to_track()`** function is an essential component of the **QuAnTeTrack** package, designed to transform raw **`.TPS` files** containing digitized trackway data into structured **`track` objects**. This tool is particularly useful for reconstructing trackways from footprints digitized using the **TPS software suite**, such as **tpsUtil** and **tpsDig**. The function reads the raw **`.TPS` files**, extracts the coordinate data, and processes it to generate **`track` objects** that are compatible with the analytical tools provided by **QuAnTeTrack**.

The **`tps_to_track()`** function reads **`.TPS` files** where each track is represented by a series of **(x, y) coordinates** stored as separate images. These data points are then processed to generate **trajectory coordinates** by calculating the **midpoints between consecutive footprints**. These trajectories serve as reconstructed pathways, allowing users to analyze overall movement patterns. When missing footprints are encountered, the function can interpolate their positions based on the locations of adjacent footprints and the specified side (left or right) of the initial footprint.

Several arguments are provided to customize data handling. The **`file`** argument specifies the path to the `.TPS` file, while the **`scale`** argument allows users to define a scale factor (in **meters per pixel**) to convert coordinates to real-world measurements. To account for missing footprints, the **`missing`** argument specifies whether interpolation is required, while the **`NAs`** argument provides a matrix detailing which footprints need interpolation. Additionally, the **`R.L.side`** argument identifies whether the first footprint of each track belongs to the **left or right side**, which is essential when dealing with incomplete trackways.

The function generates a **`track` object** consisting of two main components: **`Trajectories`** and **`Footprints`**. The **`Trajectories`** element contains a list of interpolated trajectories, where each trajectory represents a series of midpoints calculated between consecutive footprints. The **`Footprints`** element comprises a list of data frames with the original footprint coordinates, associated metadata (such as image reference and ID), and an indicator specifying whether each footprint is actual or inferred.

The resulting **`track` object** provides a comprehensive framework for organizing digitized trackway data, making it compatible with the various analytical functions within the **QuAnTeTrack** package. This structured data format enables users to perform advanced analyses such as calculating movement parameters, testing hypotheses about trackmaker behavior, and comparing tracks using similarity metrics. By transforming raw data into structured objects, the **`tps_to_track()`** function serves as a foundational step in the broader analytical pipeline provided by **QuAnTeTrack**.

### **Examples of Usage:**  
Here, the TPS files (**PaluxyRiver.tps** and **MountTom.tps**) are loaded using the `system.file()` function to ensure compatibility across systems. This approach is necessary because these files are stored as **internal data within the package** (specifically, in the `inst/extdata/` folder). Using `system.file()` ensures that the files can be accessed regardless of the user's operating system or working directory, making the vignette fully portable and reproducible. They are then converted to `track` objects using the `tps_to_track()` function. The `scale` argument is used to set the coordinate scaling factor. For the **PaluxyRiver** dataset, no footprints are missing, so the `missing` argument is set to `FALSE` and `NAs = NULL`. For the **MountTom** dataset, some footprints are missing, so the `missing` argument is set to `TRUE`, and the missing footprints are specified using the `NAs` matrix. Additionally, the `R.L.side` argument is provided to specify the side of the first footprint of each track (either "R" for right or "L" for left).

For users working with their own data, **replace** `system.file("extdata", "PaluxyRiver.tps", package = "QuAnTeTrack")` and `system.file("extdata", "MountTom.tps", package = "QuAnTeTrack")` with the **file paths to your .TPS files** (e.g., `"C:/path/to/your/PaluxyRiver.tps"` and `"C:/path/to/your/MountTom.tps"`).  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
PaluxyRiver <- tps_to_track(
  system.file("extdata", "PaluxyRiver.tps", package = "QuAnTeTrack"),
  scale = 0.004341493,
  missing = FALSE,
  NAs = NULL
)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
MountTom <- tps_to_track(
  system.file("extdata", "MountTom.tps", package = "QuAnTeTrack"),
  scale = 0.004411765,
  missing = TRUE,
  NAs = matrix(c(7, 3), nrow = 1, ncol = 2),
  R.L.side = c(
    "R", "L", "L", "L", "R", "L", "R", "R", "L", "L", "L", "L", "L", 
    "R", "R", "L", "R", "R", "L", "R", "R", "R", "R"
  )
)
```

## **Plotting Tracks**  

The **`plot_track()`** function is a versatile tool designed to visualize **track and footprint data** in various ways, providing a flexible approach to examining and presenting trackway datasets. This function generates customizable plots using the **`ggplot2`** package, allowing users to inspect individual tracks, footprints, or a combination of both. By adjusting various plotting parameters, users can tailor their visualizations to highlight specific aspects of the dataset, such as **individual track paths**, **footprint shapes**, and **colors**.

The **`plot_track()`** function allows users to choose between three plotting modes: plotting only the **footprints**, only the **interpolated trackways**, or a **combination of both**. This is controlled by the **`plot`** argument, which can be set to **`"Footprints"`**, **`"Tracks"`**, or **`"FootprintsTracks"`** (default). The footprints and tracks are plotted using different layers, with footprints represented by **points** and tracks represented by **lines**.

Additional customization options include changing **colors**, **sizes**, **shapes**, and **transparency** of the plotted elements. Users can provide a vector of colors via the **`colours`** argument, which allows different tracks to be plotted in different colors. The **`cex.f`** and **`cex.t`** arguments control the sizes of footprint points and track lines, respectively. The **`shape.f`** argument allows users to specify the shapes of footprint points, while the **`alpha.f`**, **`alpha.t`**, and **`alpha.l`** arguments control the transparency of footprints, track lines, and labels, respectively.

The **`plot_track()`** function also supports the addition of **labels** to individual tracks. If the **`plot.labels`** argument is set to **`TRUE`**, labels are displayed at the start of each track, with the label text determined by the **`labels`** argument. If labels are not provided, the function automatically generates labels based on track names. Users can adjust the label size using the **`cex.l`** argument and control the padding around the labels with the **`box.p`** argument. 

The **`plot_track()`** function returns a **`ggplot`** object, which can be further customized using additional **`ggplot2`** functions. This allows users to enhance their plots with additional layers, themes, and annotations as needed.

The function is especially useful for comparing **multiple trackways at once**, providing a comprehensive view of **track distribution**, **direction**, and **spacing**. It also allows users to produce **clean visualizations** suitable for **presentation or publication**.

### **Examples of Usage:**  
 
By default, **`plot_track()`** displays both footprints and interpolated trajectories. This is useful for getting a general overview of the track and its corresponding interpolated pathways.  

```{r echo=TRUE}
plot_track(PaluxyRiver)
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
plot_track(MountTom)
```


To visualize only the footprint data without the interpolated trajectories, use the `plot = "Footprints"` argument. This is particularly useful when you want to inspect the original footprint positions without the influence of interpolated tracks.

```{r echo=TRUE}
plot_track(PaluxyRiver, plot = "Footprints")
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
plot_track(MountTom, plot = "Footprints")
```

 
If you want to focus on the interpolated trackways without displaying the footprints, use the `plot = "Tracks"` argument. This visualization helps analyze the continuity and pattern of movement.  

```{r echo=TRUE}
plot_track(PaluxyRiver, plot = "Tracks")
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
plot_track(MountTom, plot = "Tracks")
```

### **Further Customizations**  

The **`plot_track()`** function also allows for **various customizations** to enhance visualization. Below are some examples illustrating these customizations:  

```{r echo=TRUE}
labels <- paste("Track", seq_along(MountTom[[1]]))
plot_track(MountTom, plot.labels = TRUE, labels = labels, cex.l = 4, box.p = 0.3, alpha.l = 0.7)
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
plot_track(PaluxyRiver, plot = "Footprints", colours = c("red", "orange"), shape.f = c(15, 18))
```


## **Extracting Track Parameters**  

The **`track_param()`** function is designed to compute and display various parameters related to the **movement patterns of tracks** from a **`track` object**, which is a structured list generated by the **`tps_to_track()`** function. This function is essential for extracting detailed information about the **structure of individual tracks** and their **spatial relationships**, providing key metrics that can be used for further analysis, comparison, and visualization. The **`track_param()`** function utilizes several helper functions from the **`trajr`** package, which is commonly applied in **animal movement analysis**.

The **`track_param()`** function works by iterating over each trajectory within the provided track data and computing a set of **movement-related parameters**. These include **turning angles**, **step lengths**, **total distances covered**, **track lengths**, and measures of **sinuosity and straightness**. Such parameters are crucial for understanding the **locomotor patterns of trackmakers** and assessing their **movement efficiency**.

The **turning angles** are calculated using the **`TrajAngles()`** function, providing a measure of **directional changes** at each step. The **mean turning angle** and **standard deviation** are also calculated to summarize overall turning behavior. The **distance covered by the track** is obtained using the **`TrajDistance()`** function, which measures the total **straight-line distance** between the start and end points of the track. The **track length** is calculated using the **`TrajLength()`** function, which sums the distances between all consecutive points in the track. The **step lengths**, representing the distances between consecutive points, are calculated with **`TrajStepLengths()`**. The function also computes the **mean and standard deviation of these step lengths**. 

The **sinuosity** of the track is calculated using the **`TrajSinuosity2()`** function, which quantifies how much a path deviates from a straight line. This measure of sinuosity is based on the method described by **Benhamou (2004)**, which refines previous methods to provide more accurate estimates of tortuosity for paths with varying turning angles and step lengths. The **straightness index** is calculated with **`TrajStraightness()`**, defined as the ratio between the beeline distance (start to end) and the total path length. This measure is based on the work of **Batschelet (1981)** and provides insight into how direct or meandering the movement of the trackmaker was.

The calculation of **sinuosity** is based on the formula:  
\[
S = 2 \left[ p \left( \frac{1 + c}{1 - c} + b^2 \right) \right]^{-0.5}
\]

where:

- **\( p \)** is the mean step length (in meters),
- **\( c \)** is the mean cosine of turning angles (in radians), and
- **\( b \)** is the coefficient of variation of the step length (in meters).  

The **straightness index** is calculated as the ratio **\( D/L \)**, where **\( D \)** is the beeline distance between the first and last points of the trajectory, and **\( L \)** is the total path length. This index is particularly useful for comparing the efficiency of directed walks, but it is not suitable for random trajectories, where the index tends towards zero with increasing steps.

The **`track_param()`** function returns a **list of lists**, where each sublist contains the **computed parameters** for a corresponding track. The parameters include: **turning angles**, **mean turning angle**, **standard deviation of turning angles**, **distance**, **length**, **step lengths**, **mean step length**, **standard deviation of step length**, **sinuosity** and **straightness**.  

The **reference direction for calculating angles** is considered to be along the positive x-axis, with angles measured counterclockwise. The computed parameters are returned in a structured format, allowing users to further process or visualize the data as needed.

The **`track_param()`** function provides valuable insights into the **structure and efficiency of trackmaker movements**, making it a crucial tool for analyzing **fossil trackways**.

### **Examples of Usage:**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
params_paluxy <- track_param(PaluxyRiver)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
params_paluxy <- track_param(PaluxyRiver)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
params_mount <- track_param(MountTom)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
params_mount <- track_param(MountTom)
```


## **Plotting Direction Data**  

The **`plot_direction()`** function provides a comprehensive approach to visualizing **direction data** from **`track` R objects**. It allows users to generate various types of plots to effectively compare and examine directionality within their datasets. The available plotting styles are highly customizable, making this function versatile for different types of directional analysis. 

This function supports four primary **plotting styles**, specified by the **`plot_type`** argument. The **`"boxplot"`** option displays the distribution of step directions across tracks as boxplots, providing an overview of directionality variations by showing medians, quartiles, and potential outliers. The **`"polar_steps"`** option generates **polar histograms** that visualize the frequency of steps within various directional bins, making it particularly useful for examining the spread and density of step directions around a central point and highlighting dominant movement trends. The **`"polar_average"`** style also produces **polar histograms**, but it focuses on average directions per track rather than individual steps. This summarization approach offers a simplified comparison of overall trends across multiple tracks. Finally, the **`"faceted"`** option creates **faceted polar histograms** where each track is displayed separately within a grid of plots, providing a clear visual comparison of step directions across tracks and making it especially effective for analyzing individual trackmaker behaviors. 

The **`plot_direction()`** function allows users to **customize visualizations** through several arguments. The **`angle_range`** argument controls the width of the bins used in **polar histograms**, allowing users to specify the desired **angular resolution**. The **`y_labels_position`** argument is useful for **positioning the labels of the y-axis**, especially in polar plots, to enhance clarity and presentation. Users can also provide **custom breaks for the y-axis** using the **`y_breaks_manual`** argument, which defines where the labels should be placed for better visualization of frequency data. This flexibility ensures that the user can **tailor the output** to suit specific analytical needs, whether examining **general trends**, comparing **individual tracks**, or highlighting particular aspects of **directional data**.

By generating high-quality visualizations as **`ggplot` objects**, the **`plot_direction()`** function allows for further customization using additional functions from the **`ggplot2`** package. This integration makes it easy to enhance plots with annotations, themes, and other graphical elements. 

The function is particularly useful for analyzing **trackway direction data**, providing valuable insights into **movement patterns**, **orientation preferences**, and **potential group behavior**.

### **Examples of Usage:**
Boxplots provide a summary of the distribution of directions, including median, quartiles, and outliers. This visualization is useful for comparing general directionality across tracks.  

```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
plot_direction(PaluxyRiver, plot_type = "boxplot")
```

```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
plot_direction(MountTom, plot_type = "boxplot")
```


Polar plots show the individual step directions radiating from a central point, providing a detailed visualization of the movement patterns of the tracks.  

```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
plot_direction(PaluxyRiver, plot_type = "polar_steps")
```

```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
plot_direction(MountTom, plot_type = "polar_steps")
```


Polar plot of average directions averages the directional data for each track, providing a simplified overview of general movement trends.  

```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
plot_direction(PaluxyRiver, plot_type = "polar_average")
```

```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
plot_direction(MountTom, plot_type = "polar_average")
```


Faceted polar plots of step directions display individual step directions for each track in separate panels, allowing for a clearer comparison of movement patterns across multiple tracks.  

```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
plot_direction(PaluxyRiver, plot_type = "faceted")
```

```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
plot_direction(MountTom, plot_type = "faceted")
```

### **Further Customizations**  
The **`plot_direction()`** function offers several *customization options* to enhance the visualization of your data:  

- **`y_breaks_manual`**: Define custom breaks on the radial axis for `polar_average` plots.  
```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
plot_direction(PaluxyRiver, plot_type = "polar_average", y_breaks_manual = c(1, 2))
```

- **`y_labels_position`**: Adjust the position of y-axis labels. This can be helpful when fine-tuning polar plots for presentation.  
```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
plot_direction(PaluxyRiver, plot_type = "polar_steps", y_labels_position = -90)
```


## **Testing for Differences in Direction**  

The **`test_direction()`** function provides a powerful statistical framework for comparing **mean directions** across different tracks within a **`track` R object**. It offers three distinct methods for this purpose, which can be selected using the **`analysis`** argument: **ANOVA**, **Kruskal-Wallis test**, and **Generalized Linear Models (GLM)**, ensuring robust analysis even when assumptions about data distribution and variance homogeneity are violated. The function requires that each track contains more than **three footprints** to be included in the analysis, as statistical tests for comparing mean directions require a sufficient sample size to generate meaningful results. This threshold ensures that the comparisons are statistically reliable and robust. 

When using the **`"ANOVA"`** option, the function first checks the **normality of the data** through the **Shapiro-Wilk test** and assesses **homogeneity of variances** using **Levene’s test**. If these assumptions are violated, the user is advised to consider the **Kruskal-Wallis** or **GLM** methods instead. The **ANOVA** method compares **mean directions across tracks**, and if significant differences are detected, **Tukey’s HSD test** is applied to perform **post-hoc pairwise comparisons**. The **`"Kruskal-Wallis"`** option, in contrast, offers a non-parametric approach that compares **median directions** across tracks and applies **Dunn's test** for pairwise comparisons if significant differences are found. This method is particularly suitable when data do not meet the assumptions required for parametric tests. Alternatively, if the **`"GLM"`** option is selected, the function applies a **Generalized Linear Model (GLM)** with a **Gaussian family** to compare **mean directions**. The **`emmeans` package** is then used to compute **pairwise comparisons**, with adjustments for multiple comparisons following **Tukey’s method**, offering a flexible approach when dealing with complex data distributions or deviations from normality.

The **`test_direction()`** function returns a detailed set of results. It provides a **normality results matrix** containing the **Shapiro-Wilk test statistic and *p*-value** for each track, allowing the user to evaluate whether the data follows a normal distribution. The function also outputs the result of **Levene’s test**, including the **p-value** used to assess whether variances across tracks are homogeneous. When the **ANOVA** method is selected, the function delivers the **ANOVA table** along with **Tukey HSD post-hoc results**, enabling a thorough examination of differences between groups. For the **Kruskal-Wallis** test, the function returns the overall test result alongside **Dunn’s test post-hoc comparisons**, providing a non-parametric alternative for analyzing differences in central tendency. In the case of **GLM**, the output includes a summary of the model fit along with the **pairwise comparisons** calculated via the **`emmeans` package**, providing an efficient method to detect significant differences while accommodating more complex statistical models. 

The flexibility and comprehensiveness of the **`test_direction()`** function make it a versatile tool for comparing **directional data** across multiple tracks. Its ability to perform **parametric, non-parametric, and generalized linear model analyses** ensures that researchers can robustly test hypotheses related to **movement patterns, group behavior, and ecological interactions**, regardless of the underlying data structure.

### **Examples of Usage:**
Testing for differences in direction with ANOVA. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}

## **Calculating Velocities and Relative Stride Lengths**  

The **`velocity_track()`** function calculates the **velocities** and **relative stride lengths** for each step within a series of tracks. It requires a **`track` R object** as input, which contains both **trajectories and footprints**, and uses the **height at the hip**, `H`, for each track maker to estimate speed. This value is essential because both Method A and Method B rely on this information to calculate speed. The H argument should be supplied as a numeric value representing the hip height in meters. If the hip height is unknown, it must be estimated from skeletal proportions or other anatomical information. The accuracy of velocity calculations depends heavily on providing a realistic value for this parameter.  The function supports two calculation methods: **Method A (Alexander, 1976)** and **Method B (Ruiz & Torices, 2013)**, which are specified via the `method` argument. By default, **Method A** is applied to all tracks if no method is specified. The **gravitational acceleration**, `G`, is set to **9.8 m/s^{2}** by default but can be modified if needed.

This function works by first extracting the track data and then calculating the **Euclidean distance** between consecutive footprints to determine the **stride length**. For each step, the **velocity** is calculated using one of the two methods.  

**Method A** applies the formula (Alexander, 1976):  

\[
v = 0.25 \cdot \sqrt{G} \cdot S^{1.67} \cdot H^{-1.17}
\]

where \( v \) is the **velocity (m/s)**, \( G \) is **gravity (m/s^{2})**, \( S \) is **stride length (m)**, and \( H \) is the **hip height (m)**. This method is based on empirical studies that model the relationship between stride length, body size, and speed for general terrestrial vertebrates. The coefficients **\( 0.25 \)**, **\( 1.67 \)**, and **\( -1.17 \)** have been derived from studies focused on scaling relationships in **bipedal and quadrupedal animals**.  

**Method B** follows a similar approach but with a coefficient of **\( 0.226 \)** instead of **\( 0.25 \)**, which provides a refinement for **bipedal locomotion**. The formula is (Ruiz & Torices, 2013):  

\[
v = 0.226 \cdot \sqrt{G} \cdot S^{1.67} \cdot H^{-1.17}
\]

The **relative stride length** is calculated as the ratio between **stride length and hip height** (\( S / H \)), which allows distinguishing between different **gaits** according to **Thulborn & Wade (1984)**. The classification is as follows:

- **Walk:** Relative stride \( < 2.0 \) (locomotor performance equivalent to walking in mammals).  
- **Trot:** Relative stride \( 2.0 \leq A/H \leq 2.9 \) (locomotor performance equivalent to trotting or racking in mammals).  
- **Run:** Relative stride \( > 2.9 \) (locomotor performance equivalent to cantering, galloping, or sprinting in mammals).  

The function returns a **`track velocity R object`**, which is structured as a **list of lists**, with each list representing an individual track. For each track, the output includes various metrics that describe the calculated velocities and relative stride lengths. Specifically, it provides a vector of calculated velocities for each step, referred to as **`Step_velocities`**, measured in meters per second (**m/s**). Additionally, the function calculates the **`Mean_velocity`**, which represents the average speed across all steps, as well as the **`Standard_deviation_velocity`**, which quantifies the variation in velocity measurements. The **`Maximum_velocity`** and **`Minimum_velocity`** indicate the highest and lowest calculated velocities, respectively. In terms of relative stride lengths, the function also provides a vector of calculated values known as **`Step_relative_stride`**. The average of these values is captured by the **`Mean_relative_stride`**, while their variation is described by the **`Standard_deviation_relative_stride`**. Moreover, the highest and lowest calculated relative stride lengths are denoted as **`Maximum_relative_stride`** and **`Minimum_relative_stride`**, respectively. This comprehensive output allows users to thoroughly assess the speed and locomotion style of the track-makers under study. 

The function is particularly useful for estimating the **speed of ancient track-makers** from their footprints and evaluating their **locomotion style (walking, trotting, or running)**.  

### **Examples of Usage:**

```

```


## **Plotting Velocity Data**  

The **`plot_velocity()`** function provides a powerful visualization tool for examining trajectories colored by either **velocity** or **relative stride length**. By applying color gradients, it highlights how these parameters change along the paths of various tracks, providing valuable insights into locomotor dynamics.  

The function takes as inputs a **`track` R object** and a **`track velocity` R object**, where the latter contains the calculated velocities and relative stride lengths for each track. The user can specify the parameter to be visualized via the **`param`** argument, choosing between **`"V"`** for velocity or **`"RSL"`** for relative stride length. If not specified, the function defaults to visualizing **velocity**.  

The plotting process is handled by the **`ggplot2`** package, using **`geom_path()`** to plot the tracks and **`scale_color_gradientn()`** to apply a color gradient representing the selected parameter. Users can customize the color palette via the **`colours`** argument and adjust the line width with the **`lwd`** argument.  

The function also allows the user to include or exclude a legend from the plot by setting the **`legend`** argument to **`TRUE`** or **`FALSE`**, respectively. This flexibility ensures that the plots can be tailored to the user's preferences and presentation requirements.  

The resulting plot provides a visually appealing and informative representation of how **velocity** or **relative stride length** changes along each trajectory. Such plots are particularly useful for comparing the locomotor patterns of different track makers or assessing how environmental or anatomical factors influence movement.  


## **Testing for Differences in Velocity**  

The **`test_velocity()`** function evaluates differences in **mean velocities** across different tracks within a **`track` R object**. It provides three statistical methods: **ANOVA**, **Kruskal-Wallis test**, and **Generalized Linear Models (GLM)**, allowing users to compare velocity data and identify significant differences between tracks. The function also includes diagnostic tests to check assumptions of **normality** and **homogeneity of variances** before proceeding with the analysis. When more than two tracks are present, it performs **pairwise comparisons** to identify specific differences between tracks.  

The **`test_velocity()`** function requires that each track contains more than **three footprints** to be included in the analysis. This is necessary because statistical tests for comparing mean velocities rely on having a sufficient number of data points to provide meaningful results. When a track contains only three or fewer footprints, the sample size is too small to accurately estimate mean velocity and its variability, making statistical comparisons unreliable. By setting this threshold, the function ensures that the results are **statistically robust and meaningful**.  

The function accepts a **`trackvel` object**, which is an output of the **`velocity_track()`** function. This object contains **calculated velocities** and other related parameters for each track, including **individual step velocities**, **mean velocities**, and **relative stride lengths**. This information serves as the input for the statistical comparisons performed by **`test_velocity()`**.  

If **`"ANOVA"`** is selected, the function checks for **normality** (using the **Shapiro-Wilk test**) and **homogeneity of variances** (using **Levene’s test**). If assumptions are violated, it issues warnings suggesting the use of **`"Kruskal-Wallis"`** or **`"GLM"`** instead. **`"ANOVA"`** compares mean velocities across tracks, and if significant differences are detected, **Tukey’s HSD** is used for **post-hoc pairwise comparisons**. When **`"Kruskal-Wallis"`** is chosen, the function performs a **non-parametric test** that compares **median velocities** across tracks. If significant differences are detected, **Dunn's test** is used for **post-hoc pairwise comparisons**. If **`"GLM"`** is specified, the function uses a **Generalized Linear Model (GLM)** with a **Gaussian family** to compare **mean velocities** across tracks. **Pairwise comparisons** are conducted using the **`emmeans` package**, which computes differences between group means and adjusts for multiple comparisons using **Tukey’s method**. This approach is useful when the data does not meet the assumptions of **ANOVA** but still requires a parametric approach.  

If the argument **`plot = TRUE`** is specified, a **boxplot of velocities by track** is generated for visual comparison of **velocity distributions** across tracks. The boxplot allows the user to visually assess differences in **central tendency** and **variability** across tracks, complementing the statistical analyses.  

The function returns a list of results that includes: **`normality_results`**, a matrix containing the test statistic and *p*-value for the **Shapiro-Wilk normality test** for each track; **`homogeneity_test`**, the result of **Levene's test**, including the *p*-value for testing **homogeneity of variances** across tracks; **`ANOVA`**, if selected, containing the **ANOVA table** and **Tukey HSD** post-hoc results; **`Kruskal_Wallis`**, if selected, containing the **Kruskal-Wallis test result** and **Dunn's test** post-hoc results; **`GLM`**, if selected, providing a summary of the **GLM fit** and pairwise comparisons from the **`emmeans` package**; and finally, the **`plot`** if requested, displaying a **boxplot of velocities by track**.


## **Testing for Acceleration, Deceleration, or Steady Movement along Trajectories**  

The **`mode_velocity()`** function evaluates whether a track maker is **accelerating**, **decelerating**, or maintaining a **steady speed** along its trajectory by applying **Spearman’s rank correlation test**. This test is particularly suitable for analyzing trends in velocity because it does not assume normality or linearity in the relationship between step number and velocity. Instead, it detects **monotonic relationships based on ranks**, making it robust to **outliers** and effective for identifying general trends.  

The function processes each trajectory in the **`trackvel` list** separately. For each trajectory, the function calculates the **Spearman correlation coefficient** and its associated *p*-value, comparing **velocity values** to their corresponding **step numbers**. If the *p*-value is less than **0.05**, the trend is classified as **“acceleration”** if the correlation coefficient is positive or **“deceleration”** if it is negative. If the *p*-value is greater than or equal to **0.05**, the trend is labeled as **“steady,”** indicating no significant monotonic relationship between **velocity and step number**. This approach allows the detection of gradual changes in velocity over the course of a track, which may reflect shifts in **locomotor performance or behavior**.  

Trajectories with fewer than **three steps** are considered insufficient for reliable statistical analysis, and the function returns a message indicating that the data is inadequate for **correlation analysis**. This is because the calculation of a meaningful correlation requires a minimum of **three data points**.  

The **`mode_velocity()`** function provides a straightforward way to classify **velocity trends** based on statistical significance, making it a useful tool for examining how track makers **modulate their speed** along their paths. However, it only identifies **monotonic trends** and may not detect more complex, **non-monotonic changes in speed**. Furthermore, the classification is **qualitative**, providing information about the general nature of the trend rather than quantifying the rate of change.  

This approach draws from established **non-parametric statistical techniques** for measuring association between variables. The robustness of the method to **non-normal data** and its resistance to **outliers** makes it well-suited for **paleontological and biomechanical applications** where data quality and quantity can be limited.


## **Subsetting Tracks from Track Data**  

The **`subset_track()`** function is designed to extract specific tracks from a larger dataset of tracks, making it easier to focus on particular **trajectories or footprints** for further analysis or visualization. This function is particularly useful when working with **extensive datasets** where only a subset of tracks is relevant to the research question.  

The function operates by taking a **`track` R object**, which contains two elements: **`Trajectories`** and **`Footprints`**. Each of these elements is a **list**, where each list entry corresponds to a separate track. By specifying the desired indices through the **`tracks`** argument, users can isolate particular tracks of interest.  

If the **`tracks`** argument is left unspecified (**`NULL`**), the function defaults to returning **all tracks** in the dataset. Otherwise, it subsets the dataset based on the **indices provided**. If any indices are **outside the range of available tracks**, they are ignored with a **warning message** to notify the user. This functionality ensures robustness when working with datasets of varying sizes.  

The function returns a modified **`track` R object** with the same structure as the original, but only containing the specified tracks. This approach maintains compatibility with other functions that expect a **`track` R object**, allowing for seamless integration into broader analytical workflows.  


## **Simulating Tracks Using Different Movement Models**  

The **`simulate_track()`** function generates **simulated movement trajectories** based on an existing set of tracks. It offers three distinct movement models—**Directed**, **Constrained**, and **Unconstrained**—each representing varying levels of constraint in movement patterns. This flexibility allows users to model scenarios reflecting **biological or environmental constraints**, such as directed movement towards resources, movement along geographical features, or free exploratory behavior.  

The **`Directed`** model is the most constrained, simulating trajectories that follow a specific direction based on the original track's **angular orientation**. It aims to maintain a consistent overall direction with minor deviations to reflect natural variability. This model is useful for scenarios where movement is **highly directional**, such as an animal navigating toward a known resource.  

The **`Constrained`** model represents a **correlated random walk**, where movement is not strictly directional but is influenced by certain **angular and linear properties** of the original track. This model allows for random exploration while retaining some of the characteristics of the original movement pattern. It is suitable for situations where animals navigate with **limited knowledge of their surroundings**, such as navigating within a **bounded area without a specific destination**.  

The **`Unconstrained`** model provides the most flexibility, simulating trajectories that represent **exploratory or dispersal behavior without directional bias**. It is based on a **fully random walk** with the starting direction randomly determined for each simulation. This model is appropriate for scenarios where animals are moving through **unfamiliar or homogeneous environments**.  

The **`simulate_track()`** function requires several arguments to define the simulation process. The **`data`** argument specifies the input as a `track` R object, which is a structured list consisting of two elements: **Trajectories**, which is a list of interpolated trajectories where each trajectory is a series of midpoints between consecutive footprints, and **Footprints**, which is a list of data frames containing footprint coordinates, metadata (such as image reference and ID), and a marker indicating whether each footprint is actual or inferred. The **`nsim`** argument defines the number of simulations to run, with a default value of **1000** if not specified. The **`model`** argument determines the type of movement model to be used, which can be **"Directed"**, **"Constrained"**, or **"Unconstrained"**, with the default being **"Unconstrained"** if not provided. 

The function ensures that simulations are only applied to **trajectories with at least four steps**, as calculating the **standard deviations of angles and step lengths**—essential for the simulation process—is not feasible for shorter trajectories. In cases where tracks are too short, the user is advised to use the **`subset_track()`** function to exclude those tracks from the simulation process.

The **`simulate_track()`** function returns a **`track simulation` R object**, which is a list of simulated trajectories. Each simulation is stored separately, providing users with the flexibility to **visualize, analyze, and compare these simulations** against the original tracks to evaluate **movement constraints** or explore **alternative movement hypotheses**. This approach is particularly useful for testing **paleoecological and paleoethological hypotheses**, such as assessing whether observed movement patterns are consistent with group behavior, resource-driven navigation, or independent exploratory movement.


## **Plotting Simulated and Actual Tracks**  

The **`plot_sim()`** function provides a **visual comparison** between **simulated movement trajectories** and the **actual observed tracks**. By overlaying simulated tracks generated through **`simulate_track()`** with the original tracks, this function enables the user to evaluate how closely the simulations replicate **real movement patterns**.  

The function relies on the **`ggplot2`** package to create plots with two primary components (simulated and actual trajectories). Simulated trajectories are displayed with paths colored according to the user-specified colors via the **`colours_sim`** argument. The user can also adjust **transparency** and **line width** through the **`alpha_sim`** and **`lwd_sim`** arguments. The default color is **black**, and the default transparency level is set to a low value (**`0.1`**) to avoid visual clutter when many simulated tracks are plotted. The original trajectories are plotted on top of the simulated trajectories using the colors specified by the **`colours_act`** argument. Users can also adjust **transparency (`alpha_act`)** and **line width (`lwd_act`)** to enhance visibility. This overlay helps in visually comparing the similarity between **actual and simulated tracks**.  

This visualization tool is essential for assessing whether the chosen simulation model (**Directed**, **Constrained**, or **Unconstrained**) adequately captures the **movement dynamics** represented by the original tracks. It allows researchers to compare multiple models or to test how well a specific model can replicate the original track patterns under various conditions.


## **Similarity Metric Calculation using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Fréchet Distance**  

The **`simil_DTW_metric()`** and **`simil_Frechet_metric()`** functions both offer powerful tools for comparing **movement trajectories** by quantifying their similarity through different mathematical approaches. The **`simil_DTW_metric()`** function applies the **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)** algorithm, which is particularly effective for analyzing **animal movement patterns** that may exhibit **temporal distortions or variable lengths**. This method optimally aligns sequences by minimizing the **cumulative distance between corresponding points**, making it ideal for comparing tracks where timing or pacing may differ. The similarity measure is calculated using the **`dtw()`** function from the **`dtw`** package, with the **Euclidean distance** employed to compute local distances between points. This approach is valuable for testing how well simulated tracks replicate real movements, though it is sensitive to noise and outliers, particularly when comparing trajectories of differing lengths.  

On the other hand, the **`simil_Frechet_metric()`** function uses the **Fréchet distance**, a metric that measures the **similarity between two curves or continuous trajectories** by considering both the **order and location of points**. Unlike DTW, which focuses on pointwise alignment, the Fréchet distance evaluates the **overall shape of trajectories**, making it especially effective when the global path of movement is of primary interest. The Fréchet distance is often described by the analogy of a **person walking a dog on an extendable leash**, where both can adjust their speed independently but must remain connected. The distance measured corresponds to the minimum leash length required to keep the person and the dog connected along their paths. This method is particularly useful for comparing trajectories where the overall path shape matters, such as in studies of **migration routes**, **travel paths**, or **animal tracks**. However, this method is sensitive to noise because it considers all points in the calculation, and it may produce invalid measurements when comparing highly disparate tracks, especially those generated under completely **unconstrained models**. In such cases, the Fréchet distance is returned as **-1**.  

Both **`simil_DTW_metric()`** and **`simil_Frechet_metric()`** functions allow users to align trajectories before computing similarity metrics, providing three options: **None**, where trajectories are compared as they are; **Centroid**, where trajectories are shifted to align their centroids, thus eliminating positional differences while preserving their shape; and **Origin**, where trajectories are aligned to their starting points, making comparisons independent of absolute positions. These alignment options ensure that comparisons are based on movement patterns rather than arbitrary spatial differences.  

Additionally, both functions allow users to perform **statistical testing** by comparing observed similarity metrics with those derived from **simulated trajectories** when **`test = TRUE`**. This simulation process involves generating random trajectories and comparing them to the original tracks to determine whether the observed similarities are significantly greater than expected under random conditions. Two types of *P*-values are calculated: **Pairwise *P*-values**, which represent the proportion of simulated distances smaller than the observed distance for each trajectory pair, and **Combined *P*-values**, which measure the overall proportion of simulations where all observed distances are smaller than the simulated ones. This statistical framework provides a comprehensive assessment of the similarity between tracks and helps evaluate whether observed patterns deviate from random expectations.  

Overall, the **`simil_DTW_metric()`** and **`simil_Frechet_metric()`** functions provide a robust framework for comparing trajectories, allowing users to test the robustness of their results through simulations and explore how well generated tracks replicate the observed patterns. By offering multiple alignment options and statistical testing, these tools are highly valuable for investigating **animal movement patterns**, testing hypotheses about **track similarity**, and evaluating the accuracy of simulations.


## **Intersection Metric Calculation for Tracks**  

The **`track_intersection()`** function detects and counts **unique intersections** between **movement trajectories**, helping to identify potential **behavioral interactions** such as **coordinated movement**, **chasing**, or **random exploration**. By comparing actual tracks against **simulated trajectories** generated with the **`simulate_track()`** function, users can statistically assess whether observed intersections occur more or less frequently than expected under random conditions.

The way the function works is fairly straightforward. It examines each pair of trajectories, represented as **lines made up of consecutive points**. It then checks whether **line segments from different trajectories cross one another**, recording each crossing point. Since each intersection is represented by a **unique coordinate**, duplicates are removed to ensure only **unique intersection points** are counted. This count provides a basic measure of **interaction between the trajectories**.  

The function also allows for more sophisticated **hypothesis testing** through the comparison of actual and **simulated trajectories**. If the **`test`** argument is set to **`TRUE`**, the user must provide a set of **simulated tracks** to compare against the original ones. The idea here is to see how many intersections occur in the **real data compared to those that occur in simulated, randomized scenarios**. This comparison can provide valuable insights into whether **observed intersections are more or less frequent than expected by chance**.  

The flexibility of the **`track_intersection()`** function is enhanced by its ability to alter the **starting positions of simulated tracks** through the **`origin.permutation`** argument, which offers multiple options to fit different scenarios. When set to **`"None"`**, simulated trajectories retain their original **starting points**, matching the positions of the actual data without any modification. By contrast, the **`"Min.Box"`** option randomly places the **starting points of simulated trajectories** within the **minimum bounding box** that encompasses all original starting points, providing a straightforward way to simulate movement within a defined area. A more precise alternative is the **`"Conv.Hull"`** option, which places simulated tracks within the **convex hull** that encloses all original starting points, better reflecting the space occupied by the tracks. For maximum customization, the **`"Custom"`** option allows users to specify a particular region by providing a **set of coordinates** that define the area of interest, which is especially useful when prior knowledge of **terrain features or environmental factors** suggests that movement may be influenced by specific spatial constraints. 

The results are returned as a **list** containing several components, depending on whether **testing was performed**. At the most basic level, the function returns a **matrix where each cell represents the number of unique intersection points** between two trajectories. If testing is enabled, the function also returns a **matrix of *p*-values** that compare **observed intersection counts** to those generated from **simulated tracks**, providing a **statistical assessment of how unusual the observed intersections are**. Additionally, the function provides an **overall *p*-value** that summarizes the significance of the intersection counts across all pairs of trajectories. Finally, it returns the **full list of simulated intersection counts**, which can be useful for further exploration or visualization of the results.  

The function’s versatility makes it applicable to a range of scenarios. For instance, if **trackmakers (or at least some of them) are expected to be moving in parallel**—such as members of a **herd or pack following a common path**—fewer intersections would be expected compared to **random movement**. In such cases, a significantly low number of intersections would support the hypothesis of **coordinated or parallel movement**. Conversely, in a **hunting or chasing scenario**, a greater number of intersections than expected by chance might be anticipated. Therefore, analyzing the number of intersections alongside **similarity metrics** from functions like **`simil_DTW_metric()`** or **`simil_Frechet_metric()`** can provide a more comprehensive assessment of **trackmaker behavior**.  

Ultimately, this function offers a **robust way of examining track interactions** by comparing **observed intersection counts** to those expected under different **simulated scenarios**. By allowing various **permutation methods**, it provides the user with the flexibility to tailor the analysis to **specific research questions and assumptions about trackmaker behavior**.  


## **Combining *P*-values from Multiple Similarity and Intersection Metrics**  

The **`combined_prob()`** function is designed to combine *p*-values obtained from various similarity and intersection metrics** to provide a more comprehensive assessment of how well the **observed trajectories compare to those generated through simulation**. The function can be particularly useful when multiple metrics are applied to the same set of data, as it allows users to **integrate the results and obtain an overall measure of significance**.  

The basic idea behind this function is to assess how the **observed similarity or intersection metrics** compare to those generated under various **simulated scenarios**. It starts by receiving a **list of metrics**, each of which is expected to be an **R object representing the results of similarity or intersection tests**. These metrics could have been obtained from functions like **`simil_DTW_metric()`**, **`simil_Frechet_metric()`**, and **`track_intersection()`**.  

To make meaningful comparisons, the function ensures that all metrics provided in the **`metrics` list** have been derived using the same number of simulations (**`nsim`**). If the metrics are incompatible, the function raises an error to prevent incorrect calculations.  

The process works by generating a **matrix of *p*-values** where each entry represents the **combined significance of multiple metrics for a particular trajectory pair**. For each simulation iteration, the function subtracts the **observed metric values from the simulated ones**, building a series of differences for each metric. If all differences for a given trajectory pair are positive, that combination is considered significant, contributing to the calculation of ***p*-values**.  

The function also provides an **overall *p*-value** that summarizes the combined significance across all **trajectory pairs**. This value indicates how consistently the **observed data differs from the simulated datasets** across all metrics.  

The result is returned as a **list** consisting of two main components. The first component is a **matrix of combined *p*-values for each trajectory pair**, where the entries indicate the **probability of observing the combined metrics across all simulations**. This matrix provides a detailed comparison of how **individual track pairs** compare to the simulated datasets. The second component is a **single overall *p*-value** that summarizes the **combined significance of all metrics across all pairs of trajectories**, offering a **comprehensive assessment of the dataset as a whole**. 

The **`combined_prob()`** function provides an efficient way to **aggregate multiple similarity or intersection metrics**, making it an essential tool for users who wish to **comprehensively evaluate their models and hypotheses**. By allowing for the integration of different metrics, the function offers a **holistic approach to analyzing and comparing track data**.  


## **Clustering Tracks Based on Movement Parameters**  

**Clustering tracks** is a powerful approach for detecting **patterns of movement** that may reveal specific **behaviors or strategies employed by trackmakers**. The **`cluster_track()`** function is designed to process a set of tracks by **calculating various movement parameters** and then classifying them into groups based on their **similarities**. Instead of just comparing tracks pairwise, this method allows for the identification of broader **behavioral patterns shared across multiple tracks**.

The process begins with **preparing the data**, where tracks containing **fewer than four steps** are filtered out. Short tracks lack sufficient information about movement patterns and would introduce noise into the clustering process. Once filtered, the function calculates multiple **movement parameters** to characterize the trackmaker’s behavior.

These parameters include metrics such as **turning angles**, **step lengths**, **sinuosity**, **straightness**, and **velocity**. **Turning angles** reflect how frequently the trackmaker changes direction, providing insights into whether it was moving in a **directed or exploratory manner**. **Step lengths and their variability** reveal the consistency of movement, while **sinuosity and straightness** indicate whether the path was **directed or meandering**. **Velocity parameters**, including **average speed**, **standard deviation of speed**, **maximum velocity**, and **minimum velocity**, describe how fast the trackmaker was moving and how consistently it maintained speed.  

The **`cluster_track()`** function uses the **`mclust` package** to perform **model-based clustering**, which is particularly effective because it identifies **natural clusters** by fitting various **Gaussian mixture models** to the data. Unlike methods that impose arbitrary groupings, **model-based clustering** selects the most suitable model by optimizing the **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)**. This approach is versatile, supporting **single-parameter and multi-parameter clustering**, depending on the user’s analytical needs. When **only one parameter** is selected, the function uses simpler models with **equal or variable variance**. When **multiple parameters** are specified, it examines the entire range of **Gaussian models** provided by **`mclust`**.  

The parameters used for clustering are specified via the **`variables`** argument. Users can choose from a variety of options, including **"TurnAng"**, **"sdTurnAng"**, **"Distance"**, **"Length"**, **"StLength"**, **"sdStLength"**, **"Sinuosity"**, **"Straightness"**, **"Velocity"**, **"sdVelocity"**, **"MaxVelocity"**, and **"MinVelocity"**. This flexibility allows users to focus on specific aspects of movement or combine multiple characteristics to create a comprehensive profile of trackmaker behavior.  

The **`data`** argument expects a **'track' R object**, which is a structured list comprising two elements: **Trajectories** and **Footprints**. The **`veltrack`** argument requires a **'track velocity' R object**, which contains calculated velocity parameters for each track. These parameters are used to enhance the clustering process by incorporating speed-related information alongside spatial metrics.  

The results of the clustering process have important **biological implications**. By grouping tracks with similar **movement parameters**, researchers can infer the **behaviors that produced those tracks**. For instance, tracks characterized by **low sinuosity and high velocity** might indicate animals moving directly toward a target, while **high sinuosity and variable step lengths** could suggest **foraging or exploratory behavior**.  

Additionally, clustering can reveal **coordinated movement**. If multiple tracks fall within the same cluster and also exhibit high similarity when analyzed with methods like **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)** or **Fréchet distance**, it could indicate **group movement or coordinated hunting strategies**.  

Moreover, the clustering approach offers a practical way to **refine datasets** before applying more computationally demanding tests. By first identifying groups of tracks that share similar characteristics, users can focus on the most relevant comparisons, enhancing the **robustness of their hypothesis testing**. This **pre-clustering step** can significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of subsequent analyses, such as **similarity metrics or intersection tests**.  

The **`cluster_track()`** function provides a flexible and powerful framework for identifying **behavioral patterns** from trackway data, enabling researchers to draw meaningful conclusions about the **behavioral ecology of ancient trackmakers**.
