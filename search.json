Fossil trackways provide dynamic record locomotor patterns, ecological interactions, even potential social behavior. However, extracting meaningful information ancient tracks requires robust analytical tools capable processing complex datasets. Introducing QuAnTeTrack (Quantitative Analysis Tetrapod Trackways), integrated R package specifically designed facilitate semi-automated extraction palaeobiological insights fossil trackways. versatile tool allows researchers seamlessly convert digitized footprint data analytical objects apply range statistical graphical methods explore locomotor ecological hypotheses. QuAnTeTrack workflow begins data digitization, footprint coordinates recorded saved .TPS files using tools like tpsUtil tpsDig. files converted structured R objects using tps_to_track() function, transforming raw coordinates well-organized datasets can easily manipulated analyzed. data properly structured, exploratory analyses can conducted assess fundamental movement parameters. Functions like track_param() provide detailed information turning angles, track distances, step lengths, sinuosity, straightness. Simultaneously, velocity_track() function allows users estimate locomotor speed relative stride length, providing crucial insights gait locomotor performance. Visualizing results made simple functions like plot_track() plot_velocity(), generate high-quality, publication-ready graphs. Beyond exploratory analysis, QuAnTeTrack offers powerful tools statistical testing hypothesis evaluation. Functions like test_direction() test_velocity() allow users test directional consistency velocity differences among tracks, mode_velocity() assesses whether trackmakers accelerating, decelerating, maintaining steady speed along paths. central aspect package ability simulate tracks different movement models (simulate_track()). models informed geological environmental constraints, allowing researchers evaluate landscape features resource availability may influenced ancient trackmakers’ paths. plot_sim() function provides intuitive way compare simulated tracks original dataset. simulated tracks generated, QuAnTeTrack provides robust tools test ecological ethological hypotheses. Trajectory similarity can assessed Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) Fréchet distance metrics (simil_DTW_metric() simil_Frechet_metric()), potential interactions individuals can quantified using track_intersection() function. comparing metrics null models generated simulations, researchers can assess whether trackways display patterns suggestive coordinated behavior, pursuit, ecologically significant interactions. Additionally, QuAnTeTrack supports combining multiple metrics comprehensive tests hypothesis robustness using combined_prob() function. allows researchers aggregate results similarity metrics, intersection counts, statistics single overall measure similarity interaction significance. package also includes functionality cluster tracks based movement parameters (cluster_track()). tool particularly useful detecting distinct behavioral modes within dataset grouping tracks share similar movement characteristics prior analysis. Throughout workflow, QuAnTeTrack offers flexibility visualizing, testing, comparing tracks. use R’s powerful visualization tools ensures results can effectively communicated refined necessary. integrating data processing, statistical testing, simulation modeling, visualization single, user-friendly package, QuAnTeTrack provides comprehensive framework analyzing tetrapod trackways testing complex ecological behavioral hypotheses.","code":""},{"path":"https://macrofunuv.github.io/QuAnTeTrack/index.html","id":"installation","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Installation","title":"Quantitative Analysis of Tetrapod Trackways","text":"install QuAnTeTrack package, can choose installing stable version CRAN (recommended) development version GitHub.","code":""},{"path":"https://macrofunuv.github.io/QuAnTeTrack/index.html","id":"from-cran-recommended","dir":"","previous_headings":"Installation","what":"From CRAN (recommended)","title":"Quantitative Analysis of Tetrapod Trackways","text":"install stable version CRAN, use:","code":"install.packages(\"QuAnTeTrack\")"},{"path":"https://macrofunuv.github.io/QuAnTeTrack/index.html","id":"from-github-development-version","dir":"","previous_headings":"Installation","what":"From GitHub (development version)","title":"Quantitative Analysis of Tetrapod Trackways","text":"want latest development version, need use devtools package. haven’t installed devtools yet, can following command: devtools installed, can install QuAnTeTrack using: already installed QuAnTeTrack want ensure latest version, can update :","code":"install.packages(\"devtools\") devtools::install_github(\"MacroFunUV/QuAnTeTrack\") devtools::install_github(\"MacroFunUV/QuAnTeTrack\", force = TRUE)"},{"path":"https://macrofunuv.github.io/QuAnTeTrack/index.html","id":"usage-details--functionality","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Usage Details & Functionality","title":"Quantitative Analysis of Tetrapod Trackways","text":"detailed description package functionalities, including usage examples explanations key functions, detailed vignette available online.","code":""},{"path":"https://macrofunuv.github.io/QuAnTeTrack/reference/MountTom.html","id":null,"dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"MountTom Dinosaur Track Dataset — MountTom","title":"MountTom Dinosaur Track Dataset — MountTom","text":"'track' R object representing dinosaur tracks Mount Tom site.","code":""},{"path":"https://macrofunuv.github.io/QuAnTeTrack/reference/MountTom.html","id":"ref-usage","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Usage","title":"MountTom Dinosaur Track Dataset — MountTom","text":"","code":"MountTom"},{"path":"https://macrofunuv.github.io/QuAnTeTrack/reference/MountTom.html","id":"format","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Format","title":"MountTom Dinosaur Track Dataset — MountTom","text":"list consisting two elements: Trajectories: list interpolated trajectories, trajectory series midpoints consecutive footprints.

Random terms appear single level dropped automatically. $$y \\sim 1 + (1|track) + (1|observer) + (1|observer:track).$$ Angular variables (TurnAng, PaceAng) handled sine–cosine space respect circularity avoid 0°/360° discontinuities: random-effects structure fit separately \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\) \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\), two variance decompositions averaged (Fisher, 1995). Robustness summarized signal--noise ratio $$SNR = \\frac{Var(track)}{Var(observer) + Var(observer:track) + Var(Residual)}.$$ rule thumb: SNR < 1 — observer/replicate error exceeds biology; metric weak; SNR ~ 1–2 — biology error comparable; moderate robustness; SNR > 2 — biology dominates; strongly robust. compact QC table reports SNR, qualitative rating, top variance component percent, conditional \\(R^2_c\\); also flags whether inter-observer term estimable (>1 level). Practical designs: Full inter + intra: provide multiple observers multiple replicates per observer. observer observer:track estimable; replicate scatter residual. Intra-: set metadata$observer value rows provide replica >1 levels. track remains; replicate scatter residual. Inter-: set metadata$replica single level supply multiple observers. observer estimable; residual still represents replicate-level noise (present). Note estimates can sensitive designs highly unbalanced sample sizes small; singular fits (random variances /near zero) may occur (REML) interpreted cautiously. function simulate anatomical landmark jitter; quantify sensitivity landmark placement (e.g., preservation, landmark ambiguity), use anatomical_error_partitioning(). replicated digitizations (across observers /replicate attempts) must bundled together single data object (.e., file), replicate represented track entry. split replicates across multiple files/objects, track_param(data) metadata must align one row per replicate order.","code":""},{"path":[]},{"path":"https://macrofunuv.github.io/QuAnTeTrack/reference/observer_error_partitioning.html","id":"references","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"References","title":"Partition intra- and inter-observer uncertainty (replicate-based) — observer_error_partitioning","text":"Fisher, N. .
