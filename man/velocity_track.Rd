\title{Calculate velocities and relative stride lengths for tracks}
\usage{
velocity_track(data, H, G = NULL, method = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A 'track' R object, which is a list consisting of two elements:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Trajectories}: A list of interpolated trajectories, where each trajectory is a series of midpoints between consecutive footprints.
\item \strong{Footprints}: A list of data frames containing footprint coordinates, metadata (e.g., image reference, ID), and a marker indicating whether the footprint is actual or inferred.
}}

\item{H}{A numeric vector representing the height at the hip (in meters) for each track maker. The length of this vector should match the number of tracks in the data.}

\item{G}{Gravity acceleration (in meters per second squared). Default is \code{9.8}.}

\item{method}{A character vector specifying the method to calculate velocities for each track. Method "A" follows the approach from Alexander (1976), while method "B" is based on Ruiz & Torices (2013). If \code{NULL}, method "A" will be used for all tracks.}
}
\value{
A 'track velocity' R object consisting of a list of lists, where each sublist contains the computed parameters for a corresponding track.
The parameters included are:
\itemize{
\item Step_velocities: A vector of velocities for each step in the track (in meters per second).
\item Mean_velocity: The mean velocity across all steps in the track (in meters per second).
\item Standard_deviation_velocity: The standard deviation of velocities across all steps in the track (in meters per second).
\item Maximum_velocity: The maximum velocity among all steps in the track (in meters per second).
\item Minimum_velocity: The minimum velocity among all steps in the track (in meters per second).
\item Step_relative_stride: A vector of relative stride lengths for each step in the track (dimensionless).
\item Mean_relative_stride: The mean relative stride length across all steps in the track (dimensionless).
\item Standard_deviation_relative_stride: The standard deviation of relative stride lengths across all steps in the track (dimensionless).
\item Maximum_relative_stride: The maximum relative stride length among all steps in the track (dimensionless).
\item Minimum_relative_stride: The minimum relative stride length among all steps in the track (dimensionless).

\description{
\code{velocity_track()} calculates the velocities and relative stride lengths for each step in a series of tracks, based on the step length, height at the hip, and gravity acceleration.
}
\details{
The \code{velocity_track()} function calculates velocities using two methods:

\strong{Method A}: Based on Alexander (1976), with the formula:
\deqn{v = 0.25 \cdot \sqrt{G} \cdot S^{1.67} \cdot H^{-1.17}}{v = 0.25 * sqrt(G) * S^1.67 * H^-1.17}
\itemize{
\item \strong{v}: Velocity of the track-maker (in meters per second).
\item \strong{G}: Acceleration due to gravity (in meters per second squared), typically \eqn{9.81\ \text{m/s}^2}.
\item \strong{S}: Stride length, which is the distance between consecutive footprints (in meters).
\item \strong{H}: Height at the hip of the track-maker (in meters).
\item The coefficients \eqn{0.25}, \eqn{1.67}, and \eqn{-1.17} are derived from empirical studies. These coefficients adjust the formula to account for different animal sizes and gaits.
}

This method applies to a wide range of terrestrial vertebrates and is used to estimate velocity across different gaits.

\strong{Method B}: Based on Ruiz & Torices (2013), with the formula:
\deqn{v = 0.226 \cdot \sqrt{G} \cdot S^{1.67} \cdot H^{-1.17}}{v = 0.226 * sqrt(G) * S^1.67 * H^-1.17}
\itemize{
\item \strong{v}: Velocity of the track-maker (in meters per second).
\item \strong{G}: Acceleration due to gravity (in meters per second squared), typically \eqn{9.81\ \text{m/s}^2}.
\item \strong{S}: Stride length (in meters).
\item \strong{H}: Height at the hip of the track-maker (in meters).
\item The oefficient \eqn{0.226} in method B is a refinement based on updated data for bipedal locomotion.
}

Based on Thulborn & Wade (1984), it is possible to identify the gaits of track-makers on the basis of relative stride length, as follows:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Walk}: \eqn{A/H < 2.0}; locomotor performance equivalent to walking in mammals.
\item \strong{Trot}: \eqn{2.0 \leq A/H \leq 2.9}; locomotor performance equivalent to trotting or racking in mammals.
\item \strong{Run}: \eqn{A/H > 2.9}; locomotor performance equivalent to cantering, galloping, or sprinting in mammals.
