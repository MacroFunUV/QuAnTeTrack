\description{
\code{track_param()} is a function to compute and print various parameters of trackways.
}
\details{
This function calculates various movement parameters for each track in the provided data.

It uses the following helper functions:

From the \pkg{trajr} package:
\itemize{
\item \code{TrajAngles()}: Calculates the turning angles of the track.
\item \code{TrajDistance()}: Calculates the total distance covered by the track.
\item \code{TrajLength()}: Calculates the length of the track.
\item \code{TrajStepLengths()}: Calculates the step lengths of the track.
\item \code{TrajSinuosity2()}: Calculates the sinuosity of the track.
\item \code{TrajStraightness()}: Calculates the straightness of the track.
}

From the \pkg{circular} package:
\itemize{
\item \code{circular()}: Converts raw angles (in radians) into a circular data type.
\item \code{mean.circular()}: Computes the circular mean of the turning angles.
\item \code{sd.circular()}: Computes the circular standard deviation of the turning angles.
}

The circular mean and circular standard deviation are returned in degrees in this function.

The reference direction, or 0 degrees, is considered to be along the positive x-axis. This means that angles are measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis, with 0 degrees pointing directly along this axis. For a detailed explanation and appropriate methods for analyzing circular data, refer to Batschelet (1981).

Circular mean of turning angles is computed as:

\deqn{\overline{\theta} = atan2\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \sin \theta_i, \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \cos \theta_i\right)}

where:
\describe{
\item{\eqn{\theta_i}}{ is the \eqn{i^{th}} turning angle in radians.}
\item{\eqn{n}}{ is the total number of turning angles.}
\item{\eqn{\sin \theta_i}, \eqn{\cos \theta_i}}{ are the sine and cosine components of each turning angle.}
\item{\eqn{\mathrm{atan2}(y,x)}}{ is the two-argument arctangent that returns the angle in the correct quadrant.}
}

Circular standard deviation of turning angles is computed as:

\deqn{s_c = \sqrt{-2 \ln(\overline{R})}, \quad \overline{R} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \cos \theta_i\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \sin \theta_i\right)^2}}

where:
\describe{
\item{\eqn{\overline{R}}}{ is the mean resultant length, measuring concentration of angles around the mean direction.}
\item{\eqn{n}}{ is the total number of turning angles.}
\item{\eqn{\cos \theta_i}, \eqn{\sin \theta_i}}{ are the trigonometric components of each angle.}
\item{\eqn{s_c}}{ is the circular standard deviation in radians (converted to degrees in this function).}
}

Sinuosity is calculated according to Benhamou (2004), as defined in equation 8.
The formula used here is a refined version of the sinuosity index presented by Bovet & Benhamou (1988),
which is applicable to a broader range of turning angle distributions and does not require a constant step length.

The sinuosity is computed using the formula:
\deqn{S = 2 \left[ p \left( \frac{1 + c}{1 - c} + b^2 \right) \right]^{-0.5}}
where:
\describe{
\item{\eqn{p}}{ is the mean step length (in meters),}
\item{\eqn{c}}{ is the mean cosine of turning angles (in radians), and}
\item{\eqn{b}}{ is the coefficient of variation of the step length (in meters).}
}

The straightness index is defined as the ratio D/L, where:
\describe{
\item{\eqn{D}}{ is the beeline distance between the first and last points in the trajectory (in meters), and}
\item{\eqn{L}}{ is the total path length traveled (in meters).}
}

Straightness index is based on the method described by Batschelet (1981). According to Benhamou (2004),
the straightness index serves as a reliable measure of the efficiency of a directed walk. However, it is not suitable
for random trajectories, as the index for a random walk tends towards zero with increasing steps. Thus, it is recommended
to use this measure to compare the tortuosity of random walks only if they consist of a similar number of steps.
