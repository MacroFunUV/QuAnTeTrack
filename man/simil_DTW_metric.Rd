\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{track} R object, which is a list consisting of two elements:
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{Trajectories}}: A list of interpolated trajectories, where each trajectory is a series of midpoints between consecutive footprints.
\item \strong{\code{Footprints}}: A list of data frames containing footprint coordinates, metadata (e.g., image reference, ID), and a marker indicating whether the footprint is actual or inferred.

\item{test}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, the function compares the observed DTW distances against
simulated trajectories and calculates \emph{p}-values. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{sim}{A \code{track simulation} R object consisting of a list of simulated trajectories to use for comparison when \code{test = TRUE}.}

\item{superposition}{A character string indicating the method used to align trajectories.
Options are \code{"None"}, \code{"Centroid"}, or \code{"Origin"}. Default is \code{"None"}.}
}
\value{
A \code{track similarity} R object consisting of a list containing the following elements:

\item{DTW_distance_metric}{A numeric matrix of pairwise Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances
between trajectories. Each entry represents the DTW distance between the corresponding pair of trajectories.}

\item{DTW_distance_metric_p_values}{(If \code{test = TRUE}) A numeric matrix of raw pairwise \emph{p}-values,
computed by Monte Carlo tail tests with the (+1) correction
(Phipson & Smyth, 2010):
\deqn{p = (1 + \#\{\text{extreme}\}) / (nsim + 1)}.
Each entry reflects the probability of observing a DTW distance as extreme as the observed one,
given the null hypothesis of no difference.}

\item{DTW_distance_metric_p_values_BH}{(If \code{test = TRUE}) A numeric matrix of Benjamini–Hochberg (BH)
adjusted \emph{p}-values controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), applied across the set of unique pairwise tests
(Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995).}

\item{DTW_metric_p_values_combined}{(If \code{test = TRUE}) A single numeric value representing
the combined \emph{p}-value across all DTW distances (based on a global dominance criterion, evaluating in how many simulations the observed distances are smaller than the simulated ones across all trajectory pairs simultaneously).
This indicates the overall significance of the observed DTW distances relative to simulations.}

\item{DTW_distance_metric_simulations}{(If \code{test = TRUE}) A list containing matrices of DTW distances
for each simulation iteration, allowing for inspection of the distribution of DTW distances across randomized scenarios.}

\description{
\code{simil_DTW_metric()}  computes similarity metrics between two or more trajectories using
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). It allows for different superposition methods
to align trajectories before calculating the DTW metric. The function also supports
testing with simulations to calculate \emph{p}-values for the DTW distance metrics.
}
\details{
The \code{simil_DTW_metric()} function calculates the similarity between trajectories using
the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm from the \pkg{dtw} package. The \code{dtw()} function
is used with the \code{dist.method} argument set to \code{"Euclidean"} for computing the local distances
between points in the trajectories.

DTW aligns two time series by minimizing the cumulative distance between their points, creating an optimal alignment despite
variations in length or temporal distortions. The algorithm constructs a distance matrix where each element represents the cost of aligning
points between the two series and finds a warping path through this matrix that minimizes the total distance. The warping path is contiguous and monotonic,
starting from the bottom-left corner and ending at the top-right corner (Cleasby et al., 2019).

DTW measures are non-negative and unbounded, with larger values indicating greater dissimilarity between the time series. This method has been used in various contexts, including ecological studies to analyze and cluster trajectory data (Cleasby et al., 2019).

Potential limitations and biases of DTW include sensitivity to noise and outliers, computational complexity, and the need for appropriate distance metrics.
Additionally, DTW may not always account for all structural differences between trajectories and can be biased by the chosen alignment constraints.
While DTW can handle trajectories of different lengths due to its elastic nature, having trajectories of similar lengths can
improve the accuracy and interpretability of the similarity measure. Similar lengths result in a more meaningful alignment and
can make the computation more efficient. When trajectories differ significantly in length, preprocessing or normalization might
be necessary, and careful analysis is required to understand the alignment path. The function’s flexibility in handling different
lengths allows it to be applied in various contexts. However, large differences in trajectory lengths might introduce potential biases that should be
considered when interpreting the results.

The function offers three different superposition methods to align the trajectories
before \code{DTW()} is applied:
\itemize{
\item \code{"None"}: No superposition is applied.
\item \code{"Centroid"}: Trajectories are shifted to align based on their centroids.
\item \code{"Origin"}: Trajectories are shifted to align based on their starting point.
}

If \code{test = TRUE}, the function can compute \emph{p}-values by comparing the observed DTW
distances with those generated from a set of simulated trajectories. The \emph{p}-values
are calculated for both individual trajectory pairs and for the entire set of trajectories.
Pairwise \emph{p}-values are computed with a Monte Carlo tail test using the (+1) correction to avoid
zero-values (see Phipson & Smyth, 2010):
\deqn{p = (1 + \#\{\text{extreme}\}) / (nsim + 1)}

These raw \emph{p}-values are then adjusted for multiple comparisons across the set
of unique pairwise tests using the Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) procedure for
false discovery rate (FDR) control (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995). Both the raw and the BH-adjusted \emph{p}-value
matrices are returned in the output object, allowing users to inspect either
uncorrected or corrected results. In addition, a global combined \emph{p}-value is
provided, summarizing the overall deviation from the null across all pairs.
