Disadvantages greedy nature algorithm makes merges irreversible, reassignment possible clusters combined. Results can also sensitive variable scaling, well choice distance metric linkage method. Certain linkage strategies, \"median\" \"centroid\", may produce dendrogram inversions, \"ward.*\" methods require Euclidean geometry preserve variance-minimization interpretation. transform = TRUE /scale = TRUE, distance computed transformed/scaled space. generally recommended variables different scales dominate distances. Missing values selected variables cause stats::dist() fail; ensure inputs complete (impute externally) clustering. argument k controls number clusters cut dendrogram. default set 2. NULL, cut made classification returned NULL. Setting k = 1 yields single cluster containing tracks. argument dist_method specifies distance metric used build dissimilarity matrix, passed stats::dist. detailed explanation distance metrics see ?dist. argument hclust_method specifies agglomeration (linkage) method used hierarchical clustering, passed stats::hclust. detailed explanation linkage procedures see ?hclust. analysis = \"mclust\", clustering performed using finite Gaussian mixture models via Mclust() function mclust package. approach assumes data generated mixture multivariate Gaussian distributions, selects number mixture components covariance parameterization optimizing Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Advantages include statistical rigor, automatic model selection, ability capture ellipsoidal cluster shapes. Limitations reliance distributional assumptions (normality, homoscedasticity depending model), potential sensitivity outliers, increased computational cost high-dimensional data. assumptions partially mitigated variable transformations applied clustering (e.g., log logit transforms), help approximate Gaussian-like distributions. one parameter selected, clustering performed using equal variance (\"E\") variable variance (\"V\") Gaussian models. one parameter selected, covariance models available mclust.options(\"emModelNames\") considered. argument max_clusters controls maximum number clusters (mixture components) explored. NULL (default), maximum set min(9, n), n number valid tracks (observations) entering model. minimum number clusters considered default 1. following movement parameters can included clustering: \"TurnAng\": Turning angles track, measured degrees. Internally expanded sine cosine components (circular treatment) analysis. measures much direction movement changes step. \"sdTurnAng\": circular standard deviation turning angles, degrees. Internally expanded sine cosine components analysis respect angular geometry. \"Distance\": total distance covered track, calculated sum straight-line distances consecutive points (meters). \"Length\": overall length track, straight-line distance starting ending points (meters). \"StLength\": Step lengths step track, representing far object moved two consecutive points (meters). \"sdStLength\": standard deviation step lengths, showing consistent steps length (meters). \"Sinuosity\": measure track's winding nature, calculated ratio actual track length straight-line distance (dimensionless). \"Straightness\": straightness track, calculated straight-line distance divided total path length (dimensionless). \"Velocity\": average velocity track, calculated total distance divided time elapsed first last footprint (meters per second). \"sdVelocity\": standard deviation velocity, indicating much velocity fluctuates throughout track (meters per second). \"MaxVelocity\": maximum velocity achieved track, identifying fastest point (meters per second). \"MinVelocity\": minimum velocity track, identifying slowest point (meters per second). \"TrackWidth\": Trackway width, .e., lateral spacing left right footprint series (units consistent input coordinates, typically meters). \"PaceAng\": Pace angulation (degrees), classical ichnological descriptor summarizing angular relation successive steps within trackway. cluster_track() function biological relevance identifying groups tracks similar movement parameters, providing insights ecological behavioral patterns. clustering tracks based characteristics sinuosity, velocity, turning angles (treated circularly via sine/cosine), helps detect movement patterns associated specific behaviors. can reveal tracks potentially made individuals moving together, useful investigating hypotheses gregarious behavior, predation strategies, coordinated movement. Additionally, clustering serves preliminary step similarity tests simulations, refining track selection improving hypothesis testing movement ecology studies.","code":""},{"path":[]},{"path":"https://macrofunuv.github.io/QuAnTeTrack/reference/cluster_track.html","id":"references","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"References","title":"Cluster tracks based on movement parameters — cluster_track","text":"Alexander, R.

Pairwise p-values computed Monte Carlo tail test using (+1) correction avoid zero-values (see Phipson & Smyth, 2010): $$p = (1 + \\#\\{\\text{extreme}\\}) / (nsim + 1)$$ raw p-values adjusted multiple comparisons across set unique pairwise tests using Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) procedure false discovery rate (FDR) control (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995). raw BH-adjusted p-value matrices returned output object, allowing users inspect either uncorrected corrected results. addition, global combined p-value provided, summarizing overall deviation null across pairs.","code":""},{"path":[]},{"path":"https://macrofunuv.github.io/QuAnTeTrack/reference/simil_DTW_metric.html","id":"references","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"References","title":"Similarity metric using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) — simil_DTW_metric","text":"Benjamini, Y., & Hochberg, Y.
