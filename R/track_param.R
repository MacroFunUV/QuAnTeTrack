#' Print track parameters
#'
#' \code{track_param()} is a function to compute and print various parameters of tracks from a list of track data.
#'
#' @param data A 'track' R object, which is a list consisting of two elements:
#'    * \strong{Trajectories}: A list of interpolated trajectories, where each trajectory is a series of midpoints between consecutive footprints.
#'    * \strong{Footprints}: A list of data frames containing footprint coordinates, metadata (e.g., image reference, ID), and a marker indicating whether the footprint is actual or inferred.
#'
#' @details This function calculates various movement parameters for each track in the provided data.
#' It uses the following helper functions from the \pkg{trajr} (Animal Trajectory Analysis) package:
#'    * \code{TrajAngles()}: Calculates the turning angles of the track.
#'    * \code{TrajDistance()}: Calculates the total distance covered by the track.
#'    * \code{TrajLength()}: Calculates the length of the track.
#'    * \code{TrajStepLengths()}: Calculates the step lengths of the track.
#'    * \code{TrajSinuosity2()}: Calculates the sinuosity of the track.
#'    * \code{TrajStraightness()}: Calculates the straightness of the track.
#'
#' @return A list of lists, where each sublist contains the computed parameters for a corresponding track.
#' The parameters included are:
#'    * Turning_angles: A vector of turning angles for the track (in degrees).
#'    * Mean_turning_angle: The mean of the turning angles (in degrees).
#'    * Standard_deviation_turning_angle: The standard deviation of the turning angles (in degrees).
#'    * Distance: The total distance covered by the track (in meters).
#'    * Length: The length of the track  (in meters).
#'    * Step_lengths: A vector of step lengths for the track  (in meters).
#'    * Mean_step_length: The mean of the step lengths  (in meters).
#'    * Standard_deviation_step_length: The standard deviation of the step lengths  (in meters).
#'    * Sinuosity: The sinuosity of the track (dimensionless).
#'    * Straightness: The straightness of the track (dimensionless).
#'
#' @return The reference direction, or 0 degrees, is considered to be along the positive x-axis. This means that angles are measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis, with 0 degrees (or 0 degrees) pointing directly along this axis. For a detailed explanation and appropriate methods for analyzing circular data, refer to Batschelet (1981).
#'
#' @return Sinuosity is calculated according to Benhamou (2004), as defined in equation 8.
#' The formula used here is a refined version of the sinuosity index presented by Bovet & Benhamou (1988),
#' which is applicable to a broader range of turning angle distributions and does not require a constant step length.
#'
#' The sinuosity is computed using the formula:
#' \deqn{S = 2 \left[ p \left( \frac{1 + c}{1 - c} + b^2 \right) \right]^{-0.5}}
#' where:
#' \item{p}{is the mean step length (in meters),}
#' \item{c}{is the mean cosine of turning angles (in radians), and}
#' \item{b}{is the coefficient of variation of the step length (in meters).}
#'
#' @return The straightness index is defined as the ratio D/L, where:
#' \item{D}{is the beeline distance between the first and last points in the trajectory (in meters), and}
#' \item{L}{is the total path length traveled (in meters).}
#'
#' Straightness index is based on the method described by Batschelet (1981). According to Benhamou (2004),
#' the straightness index serves as a reliable measure of the efficiency of a directed walk. However, it is not suitable
#' for random trajectories, as the index for a random walk tends towards zero with increasing steps. Thus, it is recommended
#' to use this measure to compare the tortuosity of random walks only if they consist of a similar number of steps.
