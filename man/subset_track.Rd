\title{Subset tracks}
\usage{
subset_track(data, tracks = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A 'track' R object, which is a list consisting of two elements:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Trajectories}: A list of interpolated trajectories, where each trajectory is a series of midpoints between consecutive footprints.
\item \strong{Footprints}: A list of data frames containing footprint coordinates, metadata (e.g., image reference, ID), and a marker indicating whether the footprint is actual or inferred.
}}

\item{tracks}{A numeric vector specifying the indices of tracks to subset. The default is to include all tracks.}
}
\value{
A 'track' R object that contains only the specified subset of tracks. The structure of the returned object mirrors the input structure but includes only the selected tracks.
}
\description{
\code{subset_track} is a function that subsets tracks from a list of track data based on the specified indices.
}
\details{
This function subsets both the \strong{Trajectories} and \strong{Footprints} elements of the input data based on the provided vector of indices.
It allows users to focus on a specific subset of tracks for further analysis or visualization, particularly when working with large datasets containing numerous tracks.

# Example 1: Subset the first three tracks of MountTom dataset.
subset_data <- subset_track(MountTom, tracks = c(1:3))

# Example 2:  Subset the tracks at indices 5, 7, and 10.
subset_data <- subset_track(MountTom, tracks = c(5, 7, 10))
